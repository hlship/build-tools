# 0.8 -- UNRELEASED

Added optional :output-path option to the generate-codox command.

# 0.7 -- 21 Oct 2022

Removed the `net.lewisship.build/delegate` macro, as it can't copy over the very useful docstring.

Added `net.lewisship.build.versions` with opinionated support for parsing and
manipulating version numbers.
